###  Local working branches

When you run `git branch --all`, you will also see the local working branches. These can be linked with branches on the remote, or they could exist with no remote counterpart.

- `git clone [url]`: Clone (download) a repository that already exists on GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits.
- `git status`: Always a good idea, this command shows you what branch you're on, what files are in the working or staging directory, and any other important information.
- `git push`: Uploads all local branch commits to the remote.
- `git pull`: Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. `git pull` is a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`.





- git add .
